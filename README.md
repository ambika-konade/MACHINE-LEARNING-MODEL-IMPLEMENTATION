DESCRIPTION:

Machine learning (ML) allows computers to learn and make decisions without being explicitly programmed. It involves feeding data into algorithms to identify patterns and make predictions on new data. It is used in various applications like image recognition, speech processing, language translation, recommender systems, etc. In this article, we will see more about ML and its core concepts.

Why do we need Machine Learning?
Traditional programming requires exact instructions and doesn’t handle complex tasks like understanding images or language well. It can’t efficiently process large amounts of data. Machine Learning solves these problems by learning from examples and making predictions without fixed rules. Let's see various reasons why it is important:
Why do we need Machine Learning?
Traditional programming requires exact instructions and doesn’t handle complex tasks like understanding images or language well. It can’t efficiently process large amounts of data. Machine Learning solves these problems by learning from examples and making predictions without fixed rules. Let's see various reasons why it is important:

1. Solving Complex Business Problems
Traditional programming struggles with tasks like language understanding and medical diagnosis. ML learns from data and predicts outcomes easily.

Examples:

Image and speech recognition in healthcare.
Language translation and sentiment analysis.
2. Handling Large Volumes of Data
The internet generates huge amounts of data every day. Machine Learning processes and analyzes this data quickly by providing valuable insights and real-time predictions.

Examples:

Fraud detection in financial transactions.
Personalized feed recommendations on Facebook and Instagram from billions of interactions.
3. Automate Repetitive Tasks
ML automates time-consuming, repetitive tasks with high accuracy hence reducing manual work and errors.
